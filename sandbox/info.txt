# Add new set to C.js
# Run buildSet.js TWICE (first pass gets data, second pass gets foreign langauge names)
node build/buildSet.js <expansion code>
node build/buildSet.js <expansion code>

# Now run
node util/updatePrintingsFromSet.js sincelastprintingreset

# Then IF the set was some how BEFORE our lastprinting reset (HIGHLY UNLIKELY) run:
node util/updateLegalitiesFromSet.js <expansion code>

# If the set is not 'officially' out yet, then legalities is not correct yet.
# So set a reminder for a day after the release date of the set to do:
node util/clearCacheForSet.js legalities <set codes that rotated out and the new set code>
node build/buildSet.js <set codes that rotated out and the new set code>
node util/updateLegalitiesFromSet.js <set codes that rotated out and the new set code>
