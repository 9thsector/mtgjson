Thanks for letting me know about this.

It appears that the gatherer redesign they did a few weeks ago introduced this change as well.

Gatherer now uses the UTF8 unicode 'minus' character '−' (http://unicode-table.com/en/2212/) for negative loyalty abilities instead of the plain ascii 'hyphon-minus' character '-' (http://unicode-table.com/en/002D/) that they used before.

They have retroactively applied this for Planeswalkers in older sets too, such as Zendikar: http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=195402

This was clearly intentional on their part. It makes sense since the new character is officially a 'minus' character which aligns to the MTG rules that specify the ability is a 'negative' ability. Additionally this symbols appearance is a bit wider which more closely matches the appearance on the card.

I have just updated mtgjson.com so that previous sets with Planeswalkers now use the new official symbol instead of the older ascii dash.
