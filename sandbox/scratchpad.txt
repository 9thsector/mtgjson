var multiverseids [..., ...];
loopThrough and get a multiverseDoc for each one.

var multiverseDoc = getMultiverseDoc(multiverseid);
var variationIds = getVariationIds(multiverseDoc);	// May have alternate art
If have variationIds, get a multiverseDoc for each of those as well

put all in a map multiverseDocs[multiverseid] = multiverseDoc;

Now process each multiverseDoc.
var cardParts = getCardParts(multiverseDoc);
cardParts is always an array, usually it is only 1 length, but in the case of some cards (flip/side-by-side/etc) there may be 2 parts.

var cardDetails = processCardPart(cardPart);
Finally we have the Hash map of the card details
