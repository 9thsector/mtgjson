Then create images/cards/ARN/<card>.jpg  (see what image format the original is in and ensure I keep perfect image quality)

Have it show the card (from my files) on the left and my JSON (nicely formatted) on the right.

Sort the cards by name.

Then I can simply press right arrow to check the next card or previous card. Nice and simple.

This will both allow me to ensure that I ripped the card right AND I have a matching card.

I want to make a near instant search engine for finding particular documents. The documents have a large amount of metadata properties that can be part of the search query and in addition to that each document has some text that needs to be searchable too.

Speed and powerful queries are the two top objectives. Pretend I have tons of RAM. How would I go about this? I feel that elastic search/lucene isn't instant enough? or maybe it is...
