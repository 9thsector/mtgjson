Whoops! Fixed.

Whoops again! Fixed.

Thanks for the addiitonal info, I've added the new info to my to-do list item.

I agree! Fixed!

Seems like these cards should indeed be marked as banned in Commander. Gathere appears to just be out of date again. I'll work on getting this fixed soon.

Whoops! On this page they don't have their unicode symbols and thus their names from this page did not match the actual names of the cards.

Fixed.

That's interesting, all physical scans of this card that I can find show it correctly as "Erayo's Essence", printed right there on the card.

In fact, the only 'image' of the card that has the non-plural version is the one on gatherer and places that copied the gatherer image.

According to [url=http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/magic-fundamentals/magic-general/314907-whats-this-cards-name]this thread[/url] it may be either due to the card being fixed before being printed, or intentional on Wizard's part to catch people who copy their images.

So I'm gonna stick with Erayo's Essence.

Thanks again for the bug list :)
