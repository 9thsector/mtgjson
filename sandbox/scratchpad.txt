Then create images/cards/ARN/<card>.jpg  (see what image format the original is in and ensure I keep perfect image quality)

Have it show the card (from my files) on the left and my JSON (nicely formatted) on the right.

Sort the cards by name.

Then I can simply press right arrow to check the next card or previous card. Nice and simple.

This will both allow me to ensure that I ripped the card right AND I have a matching card.
