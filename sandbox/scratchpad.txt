Then create images/cards/ARN/<card>.jpg  (see what image format the original is in and ensure I keep perfect image quality)

Have it show the card (from my files) on the left and my JSON (nicely formatted) on the right.

Sort the cards by name.

Then I can simply press right arrow to check the next card or previous card. Nice and simple.

This will both allow me to ensure that I ripped the card right AND I have a matching card.





For Webpage:
- Have downloads to the JSON files (as zip and raw .json)
Make one with rulings and one without

- Have the JSON files be versioned and have a changelog and 'Last Updated' date

- Have a picture of a card with the JSON for the card next to it.
Each line of the JSON may have a comment next to it (such as cmc : 3     // Converted Mana Cost)
Each key of the JSON should have a line outline that leads to a line outline surrounding the corresponding card part
So easily at a glance you can see where all the parts of a card come from.
Use the 'Sen Triplets' card for the example card

- Have a table of all symbols and what they mean {PG}  Phyrexian Green - Can be paid with 2 life or G
