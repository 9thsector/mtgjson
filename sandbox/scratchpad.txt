Then create images/cards/ARN/<card>.jpg  (see what image format the original is in and ensure I keep perfect image quality)

Have it show the card (from my files) on the left and my JSON (nicely formatted) on the right.

Sort the cards by name.

Then I can simply press right arrow to check the next card or previous card. Nice and simple.

This will both allow me to ensure that I ripped the card right AND I have a matching card.





For Webpage:
- Have downloads to the JSON files (as zip and raw .json)
Make one with rulings and one without

- Have the JSON files be versioned and have a changelog and 'Last Updated' date

- Have a picture of a card with the JSON for the card next to it.
Each line of the JSON may have a comment next to it (such as cmc : 3     // Converted Mana Cost)
Each key of the JSON should have a line outline that leads to a line outline surrounding the corresponding card part
So easily at a glance you can see where all the parts of a card come from.
Use the 'Sen Triplets' card for the example card

- Have a table of all symbols and what they mean {PG}  Phyrexian Green - Can be paid with 2 life or G

- Mention that the imageNames refer to the CCGHQ names and link to them.
Note that the set codes are the official correct ones, but not the same ones that CCGHQ uses.
All names have be lowercased
Mention that some errors exist in the CCGHQ names and need to be corrected:
- Alpha and Revised (A, R) mispelled "will-o'-the-wisp.full.jpg" (they forgot the apostrophe, funny enough, they got it right in B and U
- PLS: The first card Ertai, the Corrupted didn't have a 1 next to it: ertai, the corrupted2.jpg
       Same goes for Skyship Weatherlight and Tahngarth, Talruum Hero
- RAV: The basic lands, the first ones were missing the number 1
- DKA: SÃ©ance wasn't correctly named as seance.jpg (like they do with other unicode cards)
