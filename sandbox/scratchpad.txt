For Webpage:
- Have downloads to the JSON files (as zip and raw .json)
Make one with rulings and one without

- Have the JSON files be versioned and have a changelog and 'Last Updated' date

- Have a picture of a card with the JSON for the card next to it.
Each line of the JSON may have a comment next to it (such as cmc : 3     // Converted Mana Cost)
Each key of the JSON should have a line outline that leads to a line outline surrounding the corresponding card part
So easily at a glance you can see where all the parts of a card come from.
Use the 'Sen Triplets' card for the example card

- Have a table of all symbols and what they mean {PG}  Phyrexian Green - Can be paid with 2 life or G

var multiverseids [..., ...];
loopThrough and get a multiverseDoc for each one.

var multiverseDoc = getMultiverseDoc(multiverseid);
var variationIds = getVariationIds(multiverseDoc);	// May have alternate art
If have variationIds, get a multiverseDoc for each of those as well

put all in a map multiverseDocs[multiverseid] = multiverseDoc;

Now process each multiverseDoc.
var cardParts = getCardParts(multiverseDoc);
cardParts is always an array, usually it is only 1 length, but in the case of some cards (flip/side-by-side/etc) there may be 2 parts.

var cardDetails = processCardPart(cardPart);
Finally we have the Hash map of the card details
