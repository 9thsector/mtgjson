* Add token cards from other sets? May have to do this manually
If manually, then simply download all *TOKENS* zip files and look at the cards

* Add Planechase sets

* Get more complete foreign card names from magiccards.info

* Add full foreign language scrapes. Need to use ?printed=true on Gatherer to get this data.
