* Add TCGPlayer set names for each set, so those who want to get TCGPlayer prices can do so more easily. See the e-mail from Michael Norrish <mike.norrish@gmail.com> for more info

* See the e-mail from john.a.bondeson@gmail.com regarding 'color identity' field that is used in commander/edh. At the very least I should research this and decide one way or the other about adding it and then reply back to him once it's added or my reasons why I won't be adding it.

* Move all 'tokens' to a new array along side 'cards' called 'tokens' and reference 108.2 that they are not considered cards.
  Have this be done automatically AFTER everything is done (including card modifications and sorting), by simply moving any card with layout==="token" to the new tokens array.

* Add Tokens from magiccards.info
Token List: http://magiccards.info/extras.html
E-mail woogerboy, Be Titmarsh and search e-mail for anyone asking about 'tokens' or 'promo' and e-mail them
In addition to test_urls.js I need to look at the tokens folder in DevLab/images/originals/mtg/CCGHQ/full/
Could potentially scrape the data from: http://magiccards.info/extras.html

* Many of the early 4th edtion and earlier cards have messed up activation costs in the originalCardText (such as '1oRooR' on gatherer for 1RR) and also missing colons for almost all of them.
See the 3 e-mail's from Brian (eastsydneyboy@gmail.com) for more details on this topic

* Try and get the foreignNames field working for 'split' cards

* WPN and Gateway were tehcnically two seperate programs, despite magiccards.info combining them into one. Yes, WPN replaced Gateway, but right now combined there is no way to determine which set each card is from as the years overlap.

* Consider making it so the only foreignNames in the array are those found on gatherer for that specific ard in that set (instead of all languages from all sets for that card) then e-mail morpheus rabbit

* Consider changing 'printings' field to be a list of set codes rather than set names

* Add some sort of 'deck' or 'subset' field, to identify which cards are part of which decks (such as 'elf' deck in the 'elves vs goblins' set)

* Create a nginx tolowercase plugin that doesn't require a /actual/ directory and then enable this for files in /json/

* Add MTGO only sets:
  - PRM set. (promo cards, see e-mail from  Thomas Baird <thomas@cardhoarder.com>)
  - Mirrodin Pure vs. New Phyrexia
  Theme Decks:
  - Boltslinger
  - Exiler
  - Deathdancer Xira
  - Enchantress Rubinia
  More???
  
* Add the additional duels of the planeswalkers sets (2012/1013/etc)

* Add foil information to sets/cards. Lots of ways this could be done. A 'foilable'/'foilOnly' boolean at set and card level. Or perhaps an array like:
{..., "code": "LEA", ..., "possibleCardStock": ["nonfoil"], ...}
{..., "code": "MMQ", ..., "possibleCardStock": ["nonfoil", "foil"], ...}
{..., "code": "V14", ..., "possibleCardStock": ["foil"], ...}
More info from mikeherbig@gmail.com:
Basically what's really needed is three things: foilable, foil only, and non foil.
- All sets pre-Urza's Legacy are non foil. (except that Urza's Saga, the set before Legacy, which actually had the first foil in the pre-release promo Lightning Dragon).
- Sets after Legacy are generally "foilable", except that there are a lot of instances of sets that are not, like Coldsnap theme decks.
- Foil only is cards like Lightning Dragon, From the Vault, etc.  The problem with having the foil status be per set is that some sets have cards that are foil only and non foil, such as Media Inserts and all of the Duel Decks, which will typically have a single foil only card and no other foils.

* Add full parser support for magiclibrarities and then add the Oversized cards seen on this page "http://www.magiclibrarities.net/rarities.html" Probably add them as a single promo set for all oversized cards.

* Add an 'availableOnline' flag to each set that is available on mtgo. Or maybe just add a mtgoSetId to each set (if such a thing exists in mtgo)

* Add 'seeded' booster pack info

* Add 'Hero's Path' cards

* Add 'Face the Hydra' cards

* Add full foreign language scrapes. Need to use ?printed=true on Gatherer to get this data.
  If the cards have unique multiverseids probably have totally seperate json. Files like AllCards-x-ch.json or what not for each language.
  Then e-mail rubens w2net and message skibulk on slightlymagic
  Also of course reply on MTGSalvation
  When doing this, keep the 'foreignNames' field, and make sure it includes 'English' in non-english printings

* Add "Collector's Edition" and "International Collector's Edition" from Magiccards.info as pCED pCEI  (old code for collector's edition is BCE)
  http://magiccards.info/ced/en.html
  http://magiccards.info/cedi/en.html
  Info about the releases: http://mtgarchive.net/wiki/Collectors'_Edition  and  http://www.magiclibrarities.net/752-rarities-collectors-edition-box-set-cards-english-cards-index.html

* Add colorIndicator directly into the JSON. Greg Falcon mentions that it's officially part of the card and is cumbersome to reverse engineer from the mana cost/colors field.

* Add a 'frame' attribute for sets that denote what style of the set has (original, eighth edition, magic 2015, timeshifted, etc)

* skibulk requested this: An option in the source code's configuration file (on github) to toggle raw Gatherer data vs supplemented Gatherer data. Basically I want the option to download an unaltered version of the Gatherer database. I consider supplemented data to include per-card overrides, removal of the ability text for snow-covered lands, data from 3rd party sources (magiccards.info), etc.

* Add an automatic RSS feed XML file from the changelog.json

* Add links to every web page and app that uses mtgjson. Search google webmaster links, google Analytics referrers, google and bing search engines, email, github, and reddit too

* Add MTGO ID's to each card (known in MTGO as 'catId') Warning: May be different in the new MTGO client?
  See: https://www.mtgolibrary.com/mlbot_php/installer/CatID.txt
