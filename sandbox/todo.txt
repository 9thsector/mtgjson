* Magic 2015 also has 'starter' cards (those numbered 270 or higher): http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1515
  Consider merging 8BS/9BS back into 8ED/9ED and mark those cards (and 270+ cards in M15) as 'starter' : true or 'box set' : true or some other sort of notifier.
  If I do add this, make sure for the 'booster' documentation I document that cards marked as this should not be included in any booster simulations.

* Add "Collector's Edition" and "International Collector's Edition" from Magiccards.info as pCED pCEI
  http://magiccards.info/ced/en.html
  http://magiccards.info/cedi/en.html
  Info about the releases: http://mtgarchive.net/wiki/Collectors'_Edition  and  http://www.magiclibrarities.net/752-rarities-collectors-edition-box-set-cards-english-cards-index.html

* Move all 'tokens' to a new array along side 'cards' called 'tokens' and reference 108.2 that they are not considered cards.
  Have this be done automatically AFTER everything is done (including card modifications and sorting), by simply moving any card with layout==="token" to the new tokens array.

* Add Tokens from magiccards.info
Token List: http://magiccards.info/extras.html
E-mail woogerboy, Be Titmarsh and search e-mail for anyone asking about 'tokens' or 'promo' and e-mail them
In addition to test_urls.js I need to look at the tokens folder in DevLab/images/originals/mtg/CCGHQ/full/
Could potentially scrape the data from: http://magiccards.info/extras.html

* Many of the early 4th edtion and earlier cards have messed up activation costs in the originalCardText (such as '1oRooR' on gatherer for 1RR) and also missing colons for almost all of them.
See the 3 e-mail's from Brian (eastsydneyboy@gmail.com) for more details on this topic

* Consider changing 'printings' field to be a list of set codes rather than set names

* Add some sort of 'deck' or 'subset' field, to identify which cards are part of which decks (such as 'elf' deck in the 'elves vs goblins' set)

* Create a nginx tolowercase plugin that doesn't require a /actual/ directory and then e-nable this for files in /json/

* Add MTGO only sets:
  - PRM set. (promo cards, see e-mail from  Thomas Baird <thomas@cardhoarder.com>)
  - Mirrodin Pure vs. New Phyrexia
  Theme Decks:
  - Boltslinger
  - Exiler
  - Deathdancer Xira
  - Enchantress Rubinia
  More???
  
* Add the additional duels of the planeswalkers sets (2012/1013/etc)

* Add foil information to sets/cards. Lots of ways this could be done. A 'foilable'/'foilOnly' boolean at set and card level. Or perhaps an array like:
{..., "code": "LEA", ..., "possibleCardStock": ["nonfoil"], ...}
{..., "code": "MMQ", ..., "possibleCardStock": ["nonfoil", "foil"], ...}
{..., "code": "V14", ..., "possibleCardStock": ["foil"], ...}

* Added 'seeded' booster pack info

* Add 'Face the Hydra' cards

* Add full foreign language scrapes. Need to use ?printed=true on Gatherer to get this data.
  If the cards have unique multiverseids probably have totally seperate json. Files like AllCards-x-ch.json or what not for each language.
  Then e-mail rubens w2net and message skibulk on slightlymagic
  Also of course reply on MTGSalvation
  When doing this, keep the 'foreignNames' field, and make sure it includes 'English' in non-english printings

* Add colorIndicator directly into the JSON. Greg Falcon mentions that it's officially part of the card and is cumbersome to reverse engineer from the mana cost/colors field.

* Add a 'frame' attribute for sets that denote what style of the set has (original, eighth edition, magic 2015, timeshifted, etc)

* skibulk requested this: An option in the source code's configuration file (on github) to toggle raw Gatherer data vs supplemented Gatherer data. Basically I want the option to download an unaltered version of the Gatherer database. I consider supplemented data to include per-card overrides, removal of the ability text for snow-covered lands, data from 3rd party sources (magiccards.info), etc.

* Add an automatic RSS feed XML file from the changelog.json

* Add links to every web page and app that uses mtgjson. Search google webmaster links, google Analytics referrers, google and bing search engines, email, github, and reddit too

* Add MTGO ID's to each card (known in MTGO as 'catId') Warning: May be different in the new MTGO client?
