* Need to do a node importMCISet mcisets and then updatePrintingsFromSet mcisets once before publishing to get printings right

* Add ALL Promos AND Tokens from magiccards.info
Token List: http://magiccards.info/extras.html
Recent Additions List: http://magiccards.info/additions.html
Ensure the 'comment' fields for cards (as to which specific event they come from) is carried over in some form
This Get rid of both HHO and PPR from mtgjson as they should all be duplicated in the stuff from magiccards.info
Make the detection and adding of more promos a bit more automated (cron job, then maybe a single manual deploy command of some sort)
E-mail woogerboy, Be Titmarsh and search e-mail for anyone asking about 'tokens' or 'promo' and e-mail them

* Consider changing 'printings' field to be a list of set codes rather than set names.

* Add some sort of 'deck' or 'subset' field, to identify which cards are part of which decks (such as 'elf' deck in the 'elves vs goblins' set)

* Add a 'frame' attribute for sets that denote what style of the set has (original, eighth edition, magic 2015, timeshifted, etc)

* Create a case-insensitive nginx plugin (the tolowercase one I have now requires a /actual/ directory).
  Then enable this for the files in /json/

* Add tokens. Can look at the test_urls.js to get a head start.
  Will likely need to add these manually for each set, looking at the picture and entering in the data.
  In addition to test_urls.js I need to look at the tokens folder in DevLab/images/originals/mtg/CCGHQ/full/
  Could potentially scrape the data from: http://magiccards.info/extras.html

* Add MTGO ID's to each card (known in MTGO as 'catId')
  See: https://www.mtgolibrary.com/mlbot_php/installer/CatID.txt

* Sets on MagicCards.info but not on Gatherer or MTGJSON: Ninth Edition Box Set, Eighth Edition Box Set, Coldsnap Theme Decks

* Add an automatic RSS feed XML file from the changelog.json

* Add links to every web page and app that uses mtgjson. Search google webmaster links, google Analytics referrers, google and bing search engines, email, github, and reddit too

* Consider scraping unreleased sets from spoiler site: http://www.mtgsalvation.com/spoilers/141-magic-2015

* Add full foreign language scrapes. Need to use ?printed=true on Gatherer to get this data.
  If the cards have unique multiverseids probably have totally seperate json. Files like AllCards-x-ch.json or what not for each language.
  Then e-mail rubens w2net
  Also of course reply on MTGSalvation
  When doing this, keep the 'foreignNames' field, and make sure it includes 'English' in non-english printings
