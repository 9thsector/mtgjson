* Fix the 'downloadImages.js' script as it takes several runs to download a new set

* Move all 'tokens' to a new array along side 'cards' called 'tokens' and reference 108.2 that they are not considered cards.
  Have this be done automatically AFTER everything is done (including card modifications and sorting), by simply moving any card with layout==="token" to the new tokens array.

* Add Tokens from magiccards.info
Token List: http://magiccards.info/extras.html
E-mail woogerboy, Be Titmarsh and search e-mail for anyone asking about 'tokens' or 'promo' and e-mail them
In addition to test_urls.js I need to look at the tokens folder in DevLab/images/originals/mtg/CCGHQ/full/
Could potentially scrape the data from: http://magiccards.info/extras.html

* Add JSONP support, thank Daan for the suggestion and e-mail him letting him know it's up. Maybe do this as a nginx plugin that can wrap *.json urls?

* Consider changing 'printings' field to be a list of set codes rather than set names

* Add some sort of 'deck' or 'subset' field, to identify which cards are part of which decks (such as 'elf' deck in the 'elves vs goblins' set)

* Create a nginx tolowercase plugin that doesn't require a /actual/ directory and then e-nable this for files in /json/

* Add MTGO only sets:
  + Mirrodin Pure vs. New Phyrexia
  Theme Decks:
  + Boltslinger
  + Exiler
  + Deathdancer Xira
  + Enchantress Rubinia
  More???

* Add a 'frame' attribute for sets that denote what style of the set has (original, eighth edition, magic 2015, timeshifted, etc)

* Add 'Face the Hydra' cards

* Add colorIndicator directly into the JSON. Greg Falcon mentions that it's officially part of the card and is cumbersome to reverse engineer from the mana cost/colors field.

* Add MTGO ID's to each card (known in MTGO as 'catId')
  See: https://www.mtgolibrary.com/mlbot_php/installer/CatID.txt

* Sets on MagicCards.info but not on Gatherer or MTGJSON: Ninth Edition Box Set, Eighth Edition Box Set, Coldsnap Theme Decks

* Add links to every web page and app that uses mtgjson. Search google webmaster links, google Analytics referrers, google and bing search engines, email, github, and reddit too

* Add full foreign language scrapes. Need to use ?printed=true on Gatherer to get this data.
  If the cards have unique multiverseids probably have totally seperate json. Files like AllCards-x-ch.json or what not for each language.
  Then e-mail rubens w2net and message skibulk on slightlymagic
  Also of course reply on MTGSalvation
  When doing this, keep the 'foreignNames' field, and make sure it includes 'English' in non-english printings

* Add an automatic RSS feed XML file from the changelog.json

* Consider scraping unreleased sets from spoiler site: http://www.mtgsalvation.com/spoilers/141-magic-2015
  Also see: http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/2fik18/ktk_automatic_updates_for_cockatrice_windowsonly/

* skibulk requested this: An option in the source code's configuration file (on github) to toggle raw Gatherer data vs supplemented Gatherer data. Basically I want the option to download an unaltered version of the Gatherer database. I consider supplemented data to include per-card overrides, removal of the ability text for snow-covered lands, data from 3rd party sources (magiccards.info), etc.

* Add a 'foilable' boolean for sets/cards on whether foils are available or not. Then e-mail machael herbig
