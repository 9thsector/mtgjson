* The 'printings' field is nice, but it doesn't use set codes but full set names which can be a pain for others to convert.
  Add like a printings-code field or something that is the same, but with the names converted to SET codes.
  Once added, e-mail michael herbig and let him know :)

* Add full foreign language scrapes. Need to use ?printed=true on Gatherer to get this data.
  If the cards have unique multiverseids probably have totally seperate json. Files like AllCards-x-ch.json or what not for each language.
  Then e-mail rubens w2net
  Also of course reply on MTGSalvation

* Add tokens. Can look at the test_urls.js to get a head start.
  Will likely need to add these manually for each set, looking at the picture and entering in the data.
  In addition to test_urls.js I need to look at the tokens folder in DevLab/images/originals/mtg/CCGHQ/full/

* Don't add these sets, because they are not on Gatherer or don't make sense to add:
